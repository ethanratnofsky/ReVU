# ReVU

## About the Application
This ReVU project will work as a way for individuals throughout the Vanderbilt campus to 
express sentiments with regards to specific dining halls. For each dining hall, users can
comment on the dining hall, give a current rating, and dictate the presence of foods (i.e. availability).
The core feature for our client, Vanderbilt Student Government, is the ability for people to file a complaint
directly to VSG through a form. On the backend, this is transformed and placed into spreadsheets
that can be accessed by VSG committee chairs and members.

## Tech Stack
The frameworks and technologies being used for this project include React Native, Node.js with an Express.js server, MongoDB Atlas,
and AWS for deployment capabilities.
